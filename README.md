# Home-SOC-lab
An azure honeypot in which intentional access is given to the public internet in order to allow the machine to be attacked. Using Microsoft Sentinel we track the failed login attempts from the log repository that we configured and connected to the SIEM. Lastly, an attack map was created using the data collected from the SIEM.
